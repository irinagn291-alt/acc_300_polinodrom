## 1. Non-negotiable constraints

1. **No CocoaPods.** Dependencies come from Swift Package Manager, a local
   in-repo package, a vendored source folder, or nothing at all — per section 3.
2. **No shared code with other portfolio apps.** Business rules are re-implemented
   here under this app's own type names.
3. **All code, identifiers, comments, UI copy and the README are in English.**
4. **No launch gate, no WebView shell, no remote configuration, no analytics.**
   Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): this is a native SwiftUI product, not
   a web browsing experience. WKWebView / SFSafariViewController as UI is a
   reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make a
   browser or a thin catalog into an App Store app.
5. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy):** never direct the user to grant camera access.
   A pre-permission screen may exist; the proceed button is **Continue** or
   **Next**, never "Allow camera", "Enable camera", "Grant camera", or a bare
   Allow/Enable that triggers `requestAccess`. The system alert is the only Allow.
6. **No CI files.** No `bitrise.yml`, no `Scripts/`, no `metadata/` folder.
7. **Assets are AI-generated.** No stock photography. SF Symbols may support
   small affordances but must never be the primary iconography.
8. **The app must build clean** with
   `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme Perforator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`.
9. **Nothing may echo another app in this batch** in naming, layout or visuals.
10. **This is not a calorie meal-slot tracker** unless family is `food_tracker`.
   Do not invent food logging to fill the brief.

## 2. Product core

The product is offline-first. No account, no sign-in, no ads, no in-app purchase,
no analytics SDK, no remote config. All user data stays on the device.

A person reveals today's impulse card and creases the perforation so the year wall keeps that stub.

### 2.1 User flow

1. Drag the perforation to crease today's stub onto the year wall
2. Tap the sealed tab to reveal the micro-action when the deal is still shut
3. Pass when you will skip today without a streak penalty
4. Open Collection to read creased stubs and their actions
5. Browse the year wall for Kept, Passed, and sealed days
6. Retract a mistaken crease or pass before midnight
7. Export the collection from Settings

### 2.2 Essential behaviour

- One deterministic impulse card per calendar day from a bundled pool indexed by day-of-year ordinal
- Reveal-then-crease filing: the micro-action must be shown before a crease can land on the year wall
- Pass leaves today's year cell empty without shame or streak punishment
- Year wall grid of Kept, Passed, and pending cells for the running year
- Collection scrapbook of creased stubs with action text and daykeys
- Same-day retract for a mistaken crease or pass
- Pool wrap only after a full cycle; no redraw on the same daykey
- Local-only export of the collection from Settings

### 3.0 Product concept

This is the product the contracts below are assigned to. Do not substitute another.

**Family** — daily_card

**Core** — A person reveals today's impulse card and creases the perforation so the year wall keeps that stub.

**Audience** — People who will flip one card and do one small thing, not start a thirty-day program.

**User flow**

1. Drag the perforation to crease today's stub onto the year wall
2. Tap the sealed tab to reveal the micro-action when the deal is still shut
3. Pass when you will skip today without a streak penalty
4. Open Collection to read creased stubs and their actions
5. Browse the year wall for Kept, Passed, and sealed days
6. Retract a mistaken crease or pass before midnight
7. Export the collection from Settings

**Essential features**

- One deterministic impulse card per calendar day from a bundled pool indexed by day-of-year ordinal
- Reveal-then-crease filing: the micro-action must be shown before a crease can land on the year wall
- Pass leaves today's year cell empty without shame or streak punishment
- Year wall grid of Kept, Passed, and pending cells for the running year
- Collection scrapbook of creased stubs with action text and daykeys
- Same-day retract for a mistaken crease or pass
- Pool wrap only after a full cycle; no redraw on the same daykey
- Local-only export of the collection from Settings

**Twist** — Reveal-then-crease. Home is today's deal on the poster stack. At local midnight the day ordinal indexes the bundled stock and deals one Deal as Sealed. Reveal writes Revealed and turns the card face-up with the micro-action. Crease writes a CreaseMark, records the action, and files Kept onto today's year cell. Pass files Passed and leaves the cell empty without a streak hit. A redraw on the same daykey is refused. Wrap only after the pool cycles. Retract peels today's CreaseMark or Pass while the daykey is still today and returns Revealed. Crease on Sealed is refused. A second Reveal on the same daykey is refused. Seed already Reveals today's deal so the opening drag can crease. Home verb: crease-the-perforation, not stamp-the-hatch and not save-a-quote. Collection counts CreaseMarks. Year is Kept, Passed, and Sealed cells. Settings exports the collection. No onboarding novel. Local only.

**Why this is not a repeat** — Same family as Coaming but a different home verb and fold: crease-the-perforation on a UIKit type-poster timeline, not lift-then-stamp on a SwiftUI hatch deck. Kept stubs and CreaseMarks replace stamped leaves and StampMarks; Poster-locked chrome replaces Deck-locked. No food, slots, catalog crate, or art quiz.

### 3.0a Craft from the shipped portfolio

Full craft is in KNOWLEDGE.md. Follow it. Do not copy type names or layouts.
- Home: One card, 3D flip. Year grid of kept leaves.
- Invariant: leaf = pool[dayOrdinalInYear % count]. One deterministic card/day. No reshuffle until wrap.
- Never: No onboarding novel.
- Taste DNA is section 7.6. Do not invent a second look.
- A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

### 3.1 Architecture contract

A Deal is a closed fold of Sealed, Revealed, Kept, and Passed, and the year is that same fold keyed by an Int daykey in YYYYMMDD form taken from the current calendar start of day. Reveal reads the bundled stock at pool[dayOrdinalInYear % count], writes Revealed, and shows the micro-action, while a second Reveal or any redraw on the same daykey is refused and the stock wraps only after the pool completes a cycle. Crease writes a CreaseMark, stores the action text, and files Kept on today's year cell, and Crease on a still Sealed deal is refused. Pass files Passed, leaves today's year cell empty, and applies no streak penalty. Retract peels today's CreaseMark or Pass only while that daykey is still today and returns Revealed, and DealStore is the sole writer that unit tests cover for the ordinal index, the refused redraw, wrap-after-cycle, and same-day retract.

Put a short comment block at the top of each principal type stating the role it
plays in this architecture. The README must justify the pattern for this product.

### 3.2 UI contract

Poster.storyboard is the root scene. PosterViewController owns an IBDesignable PerforationView, with IBInspectable creaseFraction and faceUp, and one RealityKit ModelEntity of the stub in a non-AR view. That entity is the only custom-rendered surface and it flips the card face up. Collection, Year, and Settings are storyboard sheets of stock UITableView and UICollectionView cells. The poster is a dense type poster: one short Superclarendon word owns the screen, the micro-action sits in body type on a different column, and a quiet ordinal rail does not repeat that column. Crease is a drag on the perforation control, a UIControl whose bounds are the hit target at 44pt or more, with a VoiceOver label. Reveal is a tap on the sealed tab. Pass and Retract are UIButtons on the poster. The crease control uses the filled capsule. Retract uses a destructive button configuration. Colour, type, space, and radius each have one accessor, radii 4pt and 2pt, shadow elevation, and no raw hex. Press scales to 0.97. Year cells and collection rows stagger in steps of 40 to 60ms with the whole group finished by 360ms. Reduce Motion fades the group in together and replaces the flip with a fade. The poster fills the remaining height and the iPad width. The background fills the safe area. Empty poster and empty collection are full pages pinned to the safe area, with cutout art, one headline, one line, and a full-width bottom button.

### 3.3 Naming contract

Convention: Admission stub lexicon.

Examples to follow: `Deal`, `creasePerforation()`, `CreaseMark`, `dayOrdinalInYear`

### 3.4 Dependency contract

Zero external dependencies. project.yml has no packages key. No SPM, no CocoaPods, and no vendored source. System frameworks are UIKit, Core Graphics, and RealityKit for the single poster entity. AVFoundation and URLSession stay unlinked. Do not request camera access and do not call /cgi/search.pl. Impulse stock is bundled JSON in the app target. Superclarendon is a system face. Do not bundle a font file.

### 3.5 Navigation contract

Today's deal never leaves PosterViewController. There is no tab bar. Collection, Year, and Settings arrive as sheets and dismiss back to the same poster. Reveal and crease fuse on the poster and are not separate destinations. Sheet buttons are UIButtons with 44pt hits and VoiceOver labels. After onboarding, read ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments once. ReviewScreen today stays on the poster, log presents Collection, goals presents Year, and settings presents Settings. The contact link https://perforator-deal.pro/contact-us lives on Settings.

### 3.6 Screen composition contract

Poster-stack fused timeline (Deal holds reveal and crease; Collection, Year and Settings are sheets). Physical screens are Poster, Collection, Year, Settings, and a short Onboarding. Poster is the locked home: a Sealed card waits face down, Reveal turns it face up with the micro-action, and the perforation drag files Kept. Pass and Retract sit on the poster. The sealed empty page reads Today's card is waiting. Drag the perforation after you reveal it. with Crease full width at the bottom. Collection is a sheet of creased stubs showing action text and daykeys, and it counts CreaseMarks. Its empty page reads No stubs creased yet. Crease today's stub and it files here. with the same full-width Crease. Year is a sheet grid of Kept, Passed, and Sealed cells for the running year. Each cell prints its word so colour is never the only signal, and Passed shows no stub and no streak. Settings is a sheet for a local collection export, the contact link, re-run onboarding, and reset. Erase confirms with Erase the collection? Creased stubs on this device are deleted. Onboarding is three short pages, Continue full width at the bottom, and it does not tell a story. ReviewScreen today, log, and goals open Poster, Collection, and Year. The simulator seed pfo.demo.v1 runs once, marks onboarding complete, Reveals today so the drag can crease, and files several CreaseMarks plus Kept and Passed cells. It never runs on a device.

Section 5 lists the logical functions that must exist. This section decides how
they are grouped into actual screens. Where the two disagree, this section wins.

A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

## 5. Screens

Build the screens named in section 3.6. The labels below are logical;
actual type names follow this app's naming convention.

### 5.1 Onboarding
Three to four pages. Explains the product, writes initial settings, sets a
completion flag. Skip still writes sensible defaults. Re-runnable from Settings.

### 5.2 Deck
A first-class screen for **Deck**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.3 Collection
A first-class screen for **Collection**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.4 Year
A first-class screen for **Year**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.5 Settings
A first-class screen for **Settings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.6 Settings
Holds: re-run onboarding, reset all data (confirmed), and the contact link to
the domain contact-us URL.

### 5.7 Twist screen
See section 12. The twist needs at least one screen of its own plus a surface on the home screen.


---

## 6. Domain model

Minimum entities, named per this app's convention:

- **Card** — named per this app's convention.
- **ActionLog** — named per this app's convention.
- Plus whatever the twist in section 12 requires.


---

## 7. Design system

Direction: **enterprise · type-poster · high-contrast**

### 7.1 Palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FCFCFC` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#F5F5F5` | Cards, rows, sheets |
| `ink` | `#121212` | Primary text and icons |
| `accent` | `#2753B9` | Primary action, key figure, progress fill |
| `muted` | `#575757` | Secondary text, dividers, disabled |

The scaffold already wrote these exact values to `Perforator/DesignTokens.swift`
(`DesignTokens.bg`, `.surface`, `.ink`, `.accent`, `.muted`, plus
`DesignTokens.fontFamily`). Reach every colour through `DesignTokens` — a
typed accessor on top of it is fine. Keep the file and its hex values; do not
move them into `Assets.xcassets` and never hard-code a hex string anywhere else.

### 7.2 Typography

Family: **Superclarendon**

Superclarendon is the only family, reached through one TypeScale accessor with six steps: display in Superclarendon-Black, title and headline in Superclarendon-Bold, body, caption, and micro in Superclarendon-Regular. The poster word uses display, one or two short lines. Body sits near 17pt through UIFontMetrics and tracks Dynamic Type. At the largest accessibility size the poster word steps down inside those six steps so the line is not clipped. No second family and no fixed size that ignores Dynamic Type. Nothing sits below 12pt. Crease counts, year ordinals, and shown daykeys go through NumberFormatter. Stored daykeys stay Int values in YYYYMMDD form from the current calendar start of day.

Define a type scale of at most six steps behind one accessor and use only those
steps. Text stays legible at the largest Dynamic Type size.

### 7.3 Layout

- One base spacing unit (4 or 8 pt); only multiples of it.
- Corner radius and elevation are fixed by section 7.4, not chosen per screen.
- Every interactive element is at least 44x44 pt.

### 7.4 Component contract

Corner radius: **4pt** for cards, sheets and primary surfaces; **2pt** for chips, badges and small controls. Reach both through one accessor. Never a bare literal number, and never zero — a hard edge is not this app's design direction.

Elevation: **shadow** — a single soft drop-shadow token, reused everywhere a surface sits above another.

Primary control: **filled capsule** — the primary CTA is a full-width filled `Capsule`, never a bare text link or a plain `.plain` button.

This is arithmetic, not a suggestion: every card, sheet, chip and button in this app uses these two radii and this elevation style. Do not introduce a second radius or a second elevation style.

### 7.5 Custom rendering scope

This app's `ui` axis is **UIKit Storyboard IBDesignable IBInspectable · realitykit-lite**.

If that approach uses anything beyond stock SwiftUI/UIKit controls — `Canvas`, `CALayer`, Metal, SceneKit, SpriteKit, RealityKit, a hand-drawn `UIViewRepresentable`, or any other pixel-level custom rendering — confine it to exactly one hero surface on one screen (the mechanic's home view, or the one screen this axis exists to showcase). Every other screen — every list, every settings screen, every sheet, every secondary surface — is built from stock components: `List`, `Form`, `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, `Button`, `.sheet`, native `Text`/`Image`. A second custom-rendered surface elsewhere in the app is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

If **UIKit Storyboard IBDesignable IBInspectable · realitykit-lite** is already fully native (no custom drawing layer), this section is satisfied automatically — there is nothing to confine.

The `ui` axis value is an implementation choice. It must never appear as a user-visible section title or label.

### 7.6 Taste DNA

Aesthetic: **agency** (High-end agency: huge type, air, one accent, hairline depth.)

Reference system: **enterprise** — steal rhythm and restraint, not their colours or logos.

Mood: **Clean, high-contrast enterprise design for data-driven workflows with intuitive drag-and-drop patterns and structured layouts.**.

Home rhythm (`type-poster`, dense): Type is the layout. One word owns the screen.

High-end agency: huge type, air, one accent, hairline depth. Layout `type-poster`, density dense. Kit 4/2, shadow, filled capsule. Palette recipe `high-contrast`. Grouped reveals step 40-60ms, cap 360ms total. Last item must not arrive late. Reduce Motion: the group appears at once. Reduce Motion: fade only. Do not invent a second radius or a second accent.

Type move: Soft rounded UI type, one playful moment, no serif. Reference type feel: agency.

Motion (`stagger`): Grouped reveals step 40-60ms, cap 360ms total. Last item must not arrive late. Reduce Motion: the group appears at once.

Voice (`warm`): Human and brief. Empty states invite. Errors stay calm and useful.

Anti-slop from KNOWLEDGE.md applies. Taste never overrides contrast, 44pt hits, VoiceOver labels, or Reduce Motion.

---

## 8. UI and UX quality bar

Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Do not treat this as advice.

**Layout**

- Respect safe areas on every screen. Nothing sits under the notch, the Dynamic
  Island or the home indicator.
- The app is portrait-only on iPhone. Lock it in the Info settings and do not
  write rotation-dependent layout.
- No layout shift when asynchronous data arrives. Reserve the final size up
  front, or use a redacted placeholder of the same dimensions.
- Long product names must truncate gracefully, never push a number off screen.
  Numbers win; names truncate.
- Sibling cards, images and titles never overlap. Each cell owns its frame;
  `scaledToFill` is clipped to that cell. A chopped headline or two canvases
  in one slot is a defect, not a collage.
- Minimum tap target 44x44 pt for every interactive element, including small
  icon buttons and list accessories.
- Pick one base spacing unit and use only multiples of it. No arbitrary values.

**Keyboard**

- The grams field uses `.decimalPad`, and the decimal separator matches the
  user's locale.
- Content scrolls out from under the keyboard. The focused field is always
  visible.
- Tapping outside the field, or scrolling, dismisses the keyboard.
- Validate on the fly: reject negative and non-numeric input rather than
  crashing the parser later.

**Loading and state**

- Every asynchronous operation has a visible loading state.
- Guard against the spinner flash: if the work finishes in under 150 ms, do not
  show a spinner at all.
- Every list has a designed empty state containing a primary action, not just a
  sentence of text.
- Every error state offers a retry, and states plainly what failed.
- Disable the primary button while its action is in flight so it cannot be
  double-tapped into a double push or a duplicate entry.

**Typography and accessibility**

- All text scales with Dynamic Type. Verify at the largest accessibility size:
  nothing may clip or overlap.
- Every icon-only control has an `accessibilityLabel`. Decorative images are
  marked as decorative so VoiceOver skips them.
- Colour is never the only signal. Pair it with a label, a shape or an icon.
- Honour Reduce Motion: replace movement-heavy transitions with a fade.
- Meet contrast requirements against the palette in section 7. Check the muted
  colour against the background specifically; that is where these palettes fail.

**Formatting**

- Format every number with `NumberFormatter`, never string interpolation. Group
  separators and decimal separators must follow the locale.
- Energy is shown as a whole number of kcal. Macros are shown with at most one
  decimal place.
- Round only at the point of display. Stored values keep full precision.
- Day boundaries use `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:)` in the user's current
  time zone. Handle the day changing while the app is open, and handle the
  short and long days that daylight saving produces.
- Unknown macro values render as a dash or the word "unknown", never as 0.

**Motion and feedback**

- One haptic on a successful commit (a food logged, a target saved). No haptic
  on navigation.
- Animations are short (0.2 to 0.35 s) and use a single shared easing curve.
- Nothing animates on first appearance of a screen except an intentional entry
  transition.

**Navigation**

- Back always works and never loses entered data without asking.
- A destructive action (delete a log row, reset all data) is confirmed.
- Modal sheets can always be dismissed; there is no dead end.
- Deep state is restorable: relaunching returns the user to a sane screen.


Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Section 7.4 fixed the numbers —
this is where they have to show up on screen.

**Hierarchy and density**

- Every screen has exactly one dominant element (a hero number, a canvas, a
  primary card) that the eye lands on first. A screen where every element has
  equal weight reads as a spreadsheet, not a product.
- Related content is grouped into a card or a section with the elevation
  style from 7.4, not left floating on the bare background.
- Unused flat background is not "minimal" — see the density rule in
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`. If a screen has room left after the mechanic and the
  content, add a secondary surface (a stat strip, a recent-activity card, a
  related-item row), not a `Spacer`.

**Components**

- Every card, sheet, chip, row and button in the app uses the corner radius
  and elevation from section 7.4. No screen introduces its own radius or its
  own shadow value "just for this one card".
- Buttons have a pressed state (`ButtonStyle` with a scale or opacity change
  on `isPressed`) and a disabled state that is visibly different, not just
  non-interactive.
- Chips and badges are pill or rounded-rect shaped per 7.4, never a bare
  `Text` with no background sitting where a control is expected.
- A functional control (add, filter, sort, close, more, share, delete) is an
  SF Symbol inside a properly hit-targeted `Button`. SF Symbols are fine and
  expected here — section 16 only bans them as the app's primary brand
  iconography (app icon, empty-state hero, onboarding art), which is what the
  generated assets in section 13 are for.

**Depth and material**

- At least one surface in the app (a sheet, a modal, a floating toolbar) uses
  the elevation style from 7.4 to visibly sit above the content behind it.
  A flat app with no depth anywhere reads as a wireframe.
- Icons and generated art sit on the surface colour from 7.1, never directly
  on a colour that makes their edges disappear.

**Motion as feedback, not decoration**

- The one dominant element in a screen (7.4's primary control, the mechanic's
  hero) responds visibly to touch: a scale, a colour shift, a haptic — pick
  at least one. A control that looks identical pressed and unpressed reads as
  broken, not calm.

**Taste DNA (section 7.6)**

- Home uses the assigned layout family and density. Three identical equal-weight
  cards, a leftover bento hole, or a second column structure copied down the
  page is a defect.
- Copy follows the assigned voice. No em-dash, no elevate/unlock/seamless, no
  emoji, no SECTION 01 labels.
- Motion follows the assigned personality and honours Reduce Motion with a fade.
  One signature motion per view. No glow stacked on glass stacked on spring.
- Tokens by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not wear primary.


---

## 9. Concurrency

The target builds with Swift 6.2 and `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`. It
must compile with **zero concurrency warnings**. Warnings here become crashes
later, so they are not negotiable.

- All UI types are `@MainActor`. Annotate the type, not individual methods.
- Any value crossing an actor boundary is `Sendable`. Prefer immutable structs
  of primitives.
- Do not use `@unchecked Sendable`. If it is genuinely unavoidable, it needs a
  comment explaining what guarantees the safety.
- No mutable global state. No `static var` that is written after launch.
- Networking and storage APIs are `async` and honour cancellation. When the
  search query changes, cancel the in-flight task; do not let a stale response
  overwrite fresh results.
- Use structured concurrency. Avoid `Task.detached` unless there is a stated
  reason. Never fire a `Task` that outlives the view without owning it.
- Never use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to paper over an ordering problem.
  Fix the ordering.
- `Timer` and notification observers are invalidated in `deinit` or on
  disappear.


---

## 10. Persistence engineering

Chosen technology: **UserDefaults+Codable · one Chart root record holding Islands, Books, Sessions, Runs and Rhumbs, encoded under a single key with a debounced save after each mark**

UserDefaults stores one Codable Chart root, DealChart, as JSON under the single key pfo.chart.v1. schemaVersion starts at 1. The five collections fill the assigned chart slots under stub names: stock is the Islands slot and holds the bundled pool in fixed order, year is the Books slot and holds Deals keyed by Int YYYYMMDD, live is the Sessions slot and holds today's Deal, creases is the Runs slot and holds CreaseMarks, and passes is the Rhumbs slot and holds Pass records. Swift type names stay Deal, Stock, CreaseMark, and Pass. Encode off the main thread, then write the one key. Each Reveal, Crease, Pass, or Retract debounces that save by about 400ms, and the store flushes when the scene resigns active or enters the background. The previous JSON is copied to pfo.chart.v1.bak before replace. A failed decode restores the backup, then a Sealed deal for today, and does not crash. Views talk only to DealStore. resetAllData() removes both keys and is reachable from Settings. Tests use a private suite. The simulator seed runs once behind pfo.demo.v1 and never runs on a device.

This app persists to **files on disk**. The following are mandatory.

- Write atomically. Either `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` or write to a
  temporary file and `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. A non-atomic write that is
  interrupted leaves a truncated file and the app will not launch.
- Create the containing directory with
  `withIntermediateDirectories: true` before the first write.
- Every document carries a `schemaVersion` field from version 1, and the decoder
  switches on it.
- Decoding failure must be recoverable: keep the previous good file as a
  `.backup`, fall back to it, and if that also fails start from empty state and
  tell the user. Never crash on a corrupt file.
- All file IO happens off the main thread. The main thread never blocks on disk.
- Debounce writes during rapid edits, but force a flush when `scenePhase`
  becomes `.inactive` or `.background`, and after any destructive action.
- Exclude caches from backup with `URLResourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup` where
  appropriate; user data belongs in Application Support and should be backed up.
- Keep an explicit in-memory source of truth and treat the file as a projection
  of it, so a failed write never leaves the UI showing data that does not exist.


Regardless of technology:

- One seam between domain logic and storage; the UI never touches storage types.
- Writes survive a force-quit. Do not rely on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- Provide `resetAllData()`, used by tests and reachable from Settings.

---

## 11. Networking

- One client type owns both Open Food Facts endpoints.
- Set `User-Agent` on every request. Open Food Facts throttles clients that do
  not identify themselves.
- 15 second timeout. One retry on a transient transport failure, then a typed
  error. Do not retry a 404.
- Cancel the in-flight search when the query changes. Debounce input by roughly
  300 ms.
- Decode into DTO types that mirror the JSON exactly, then map to domain types.
  Never decode straight into your domain model.
- Dedicated `JSONDecoder` with `.useDefaultKeys`. Never `convertFromSnakeCase` —
  Open Food Facts keys like `energy-kcal_100g` break snake_case conversion.
- Resolve a scanned code with `GET /api/v2/product/<barcode>.json`, not a search.
- Open Food Facts data is user-contributed and frequently incomplete. Every
  numeric field is optional. A product with no energy value is a normal case
  that the UI must present, not an error.
- Some numeric fields arrive as strings. The decoder must accept both a number
  and a numeric string for every nutriment.
- `status` of `0` in the product response means not found. Map it to a distinct
  error case so the UI can offer manual entry.
- Never crash on malformed JSON. A decoding failure is a handled error.
- Cache every resolved product locally on success, so the app degrades to a
  working offline catalogue.


Set `User-Agent: Perforator/1.0 (iOS; +https://perforator-deal.pro)` on every request. Never reuse another app's string.
No required remote catalog. Network only if this product actually needs it.

---

## 11b. App Store readiness

The app must be submittable without further work.

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the target, declaring the UserDefaults access API
  reason `CA92.1` and the file timestamp reason `C617.1`, with
  `NSPrivacyTracking` false and no collected data types.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` in the pbxproj so TestFlight
  does not sit on Missing Compliance.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` written specifically for this app. Generic strings
  get rejected.
- `LSApplicationCategoryType` of `public.app-category.healthcare-fitness`.
- Portrait only, iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).
- No account, no sign-in, no delete-account flow, no in-app purchase, no ads, no
  user-generated content, and therefore no report or block UI.
- App Tracking Transparency is never invoked.
- The camera is the only sensitive permission requested.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy): do not encourage or direct the user to grant camera
  access. A pre-permission screen may exist, but the proceed button must be
  **Continue** or **Next** — never "Allow camera", "Enable camera",
  "Grant camera", or a bare Allow/Enable that calls `requestAccess`. The
  system dialog is the only Allow. Denied/restricted offers Open Settings.
- The app must not present itself as a clinician or as medical advice.
- Guideline 4.2 (Design — Minimum Functionality): the binary must be a native
  product, not a web browsing experience. No WKWebView / SFSafariViewController
  / UIWebView as home, a tab, or the primary UX. A content catalog, article
  reader, or site wrapper that could be a website is a reject. Push
  notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make that acceptable.
- Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety — Physical Harm): if the binary shows health or
  medical recommendations, body-based targets, dosages, "you should" guidance,
  or product health claims (food, drink, supplement, remedy), put citations
  in the app. Tappable links to the sources, easy to find: same screen as the
  claim, or a Sources row one tap from Settings. Name the source (Open Food
  Facts, USDA FoodData Central, WHO, NIH MedlinePlus, …) and link it. A
  "not medical advice" footer without sources is a reject. A personal log
  that never advises does not invent claims to cite.
- Nutrition catalog data is credited to the database this app actually uses
  (Open Food Facts unless the spec names another). Credit is a tappable link,
  not a dead "OpenFoodFacts" label.


### First minute on a clean install (Guideline 2.1)

A reviewer judges completeness (Guideline 2.1) in the first minute on a clean
install. The loop must finish there without knowing the app's rules. Long form:
`docs/REVIEW-LESSONS-2026-09-25.md`.

- The home verb writes a visible object on the first tap of a clean install:
  a row, a card, a mark on the dial. No second screen needed to see it.
- Never leave the home control disabled until an unexplained condition holds
  ("two links first", "long press first", "add a volume first"). Accept the
  first input with sane defaults and show the rule afterwards.
- The twist fires after a successful write, as a visible consequence (a highlight,
  a caption, a next step), never instead of the write.
- A refusal is allowed only after the first success, and it must name the next
  tap that works.
- Nothing in the first session waits for midnight, a second day, a second item or
  a streak. A screen that can only fill later shows its action, not a wait.
- Every empty state names one action, and that action completes on the spot.
- Next to home there is at least one more screen that works on a clean install.
- The subtitle and the first description line name an everyday action a stranger
  understands. Coined words may decorate labels; each primary button still says
  what it does.
- A failed network lookup falls back to local data or typed input with a message;
  the loop still finishes offline.


Ignore the food-log and Open Food Facts lines above when they conflict with this
family. Category for this app is `public.app-category.lifestyle`. Camera permission only if the
product actually captures.

Project settings that follow from the above:

```yaml
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIUserInterfaceStyle: Light

## 12. Functional twist: Reveal-then-crease (Reveal opens today's deal from ordinal stock; Crease files the micro-action onto the year cell; Pass files empty without shame; a redraw on the same daykey is refused; wrap only after the pool cycles)

Home is today's deal on the poster stack, and the home verb is a drag that creases the perforation once the card is face up. At local midnight the day-of-year ordinal deals one Sealed stub from the bundled stock, Reveal writes Revealed and shows the micro-action, and Crease then files that action on today's year cell as Kept. Pass files Passed and leaves the cell empty with no shame line and no streak, and a second Reveal or a redraw on the same daykey is refused. The stock wraps only after the pool completes a cycle, Retract peels today's CreaseMark or Pass while the daykey is still today and returns Revealed, and Crease on Sealed is refused. The simulator seed already Reveals today's deal so the opening drag can crease, Collection counts CreaseMarks, the year wall shows Kept, Passed, and Sealed cells, and Settings exports that collection on the device only.

This is the app's marketed differentiator. It must be:

- visible on the home screen, not buried in settings;
- backed by real persisted data, not a cosmetic flourish;
- covered by at least one unit test;
- described in the README as the reason a user would pick this app.

## 13. AI-generated assets

Art style: **Soft 3D clay icons · illustration**


Base prompt, reused and extended for every asset:

```
Soft 3D clay icons, illustrated as solid studio objects with a matte modeled skin and a gentle rounded highlight. One clear subject, quiet field, hairline depth, no text, no letters, no glass, no wire frame, no hollow box, no film-set diorama, no wall of equal figures.
```

All 12 images below are required. Generate each one, export
as PNG, and add it to `Assets.xcassets` as its own image set named exactly as
given. Every name carries the `pfo_` prefix.

### 13.1 App icon rules (strict)

The icon is rejected by App Store Connect if any of these are wrong:

- Exactly **1024 x 1024 px**.
- **No alpha channel.**
- sRGB colour profile, 8 bits per channel, PNG.
- **No text and no words** in the artwork.
- **No rounded corners and no built-in mask.**
- The subject stays inside the middle 80%.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pfo_AppIcon` | 1024x1024 | **NO** | App Store icon. NO alpha channel, NO transparency, NO text, NO rounded corners, NO drop shadow outside the canvas. |
| 2 | `pfo_Splash` | 1290x2796 | fill | Launch background. The middle third must stay quiet so the wordmark reads on top. |
| 3 | `pfo_Onboarding1` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 1 illustration: what the app is for. |
| 4 | `pfo_Onboarding2` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 2 illustration: the main verb. |

| 6 | `pfo_EmptyHome` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: the home screen has nothing yet. Calm and inviting, never sad. |
| 7 | `pfo_EmptyList` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: a secondary list has no rows. |
| 8 | `pfo_CardBackdrop` | 1200x800 | fill | Backdrop art for a primary card. Low contrast so text stays readable. |
| 9 | `pfo_ControlFace` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Custom control artwork used for the primary interactive element. |
| 10 | `pfo_TwistHero` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Hero art for the 'Reveal-then-crease (Reveal opens today's deal from ordinal stock; Crease files the micro-action onto the year cell; Pass files empty without shame; a redraw on the same daykey is refused; wrap only after the pool cycles)' feature screen. |
| 11 | `pfo_SuccessMark` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Shown briefly when the primary action succeeds. |
| 12 | `pfo_HeaderDecor` | 1200x600 | **required cutout** | Decorative header accent on the main screen. |

### 13.3 Asset rules

- Cut-outs (everything except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop): isolated subject,
  real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. No square plate.
- Assets must be semantically different from each other.
- Record the exact prompt used for every asset in the README.
- SF Symbols are permitted only for close, chevron, share and similar system
  affordances.

Scanner frames, reticles, and seamless tiles are drawn in SwiftUI via `Path` or `Shape`. GenerateImage is not used for those. Every other in-app graphic (except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop) is a **cutout**: isolated SOLID opaque subject in the center, real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon is a fail. A hollow glass box or wire frame with a transparent center is a fail.

## 14. Demo data

Seed a small local demo dataset for this family's entities so Simulator
screenshots are not empty. The same seed must mark onboarding complete and
fill the primary surface — otherwise `-ReviewScreen` never fires. Never seed
on a physical device. Guard with `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` and
`pfo.demo.v1`.

Seed the happy path: the home primary verb is enabled. The blocked / gated /
error state is a unit-test fixture, not Simulator home. Home chrome names the
job and the next tap in words a stranger knows. Axis values (`ui`, `naming`,
`architecture`) never become user-visible titles. A card that looks tappable
is a `Button`. A readout does not use button chrome.

---

## 16. Anti-patterns

The following will fail review:

- `try!`, `as!`, or force-unwrapping anything derived from the network, the
  database or a file.
- `fatalError` anywhere reachable at runtime. It is acceptable only for a
  programmer error in an initialiser that cannot fail in practice, and needs a
  comment.
- Swallowing an error with an empty `catch`.
- `print` used as production logging.
- A hard-coded hex colour outside the single colour accessor.
- A hard-coded font name outside the single typography accessor.
- An SF Symbol used as the app's brand iconography — the app icon, the
  empty-state hero, or onboarding art. Those come from section 13. SF Symbols
  are the right choice for every functional control (add, filter, sort,
  close, share, delete) — leaving those as bare text instead of a symbol is
  also a defect.
- Storing a value that can be computed (day totals, remaining budget, macro
  percentages).
- Blocking the main thread on disk or network work.
- `UIScreen.main` for sizing. Use the geometry the layout system gives you.
- Index positions used as list identity. Identity is a stable identifier.
- A view that reaches into the persistence layer directly, bypassing the
  architecture's designated seam.
- Business logic inside a `View` body or a `UIViewController` method, when the
  assigned architecture places it elsewhere.
- Copying a source file from another app in this batch.
- A `TabView` with exactly three tabs. That is the factory stamp — two or
  four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. ReviewScreen keys are
  not tabs.


---

## 17. Tests

Add a unit test target `PerforatorTests` covering at minimum:

1. The core domain invariant of this family (the thing that would be wrong if
   the calculator, decay, crate, or log lied).
2. Empty, populated and invalid input paths for the primary verb.
3. The section 12 twist logic.
4. One architecture-specific test proving the pattern holds.
5. A persistence round-trip: write, relaunch-equivalent reload, verify.
6. `Perforator/ReviewLaunch.swift` (scaffold, keep it) parses `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments`.
   Read `ReviewLaunch.screen` once after onboarding:
   `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` switches the running app's live navigation. Extra cover slugs open those screens.
   Cover that parser with a unit test. Do not host a `View` in the test.

---

## 18. README.md

Write `README.md` at the app folder root covering:

1. What the app does and who it is for.
2. The architecture used and **why** it suits this product.
3. The unique feature added and how it works.
4. The AI art style and the exact prompt used for every asset.
5. How this app differs from others in the batch.
6. Build instructions.

## 20. Build commands

```bash
cd Perforator
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild build-for-testing -scheme Perforator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' -jobs 4 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO -derivedDataPath '/Users/belzephyrus/Documents/gambling-factory/.artifacts/genesis/com.perforator.deal/DerivedData' SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES

```

Signing is off only on that command line. Do not put CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED, CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY, DEVELOPMENT_TEAM, SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS or -derivedDataPath in project.yml — they are command-line only. CI signs the archive. Leave CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic as the scaffold set it. The exact simulator does not matter — use any available UDID from the list.
